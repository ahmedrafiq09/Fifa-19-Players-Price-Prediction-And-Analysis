# ⚽ FIFA 19 Player Price Prediction and Analysis 🎮

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
Welcome to the **FIFA 19 Player Price Prediction and Analysis** project! In this project, we aim to predict the market prices of FIFA 19 players based on their attributes using machine learning models. With detailed player statistics such as ratings, physical attributes, and performance data, we will explore various data processing techniques and build predictive models to forecast player prices. 📊

## 🔍 **Problem Statement**
FIFA 19 features thousands of players, each with their own unique attributes. Accurately predicting the price of these players is essential for fantasy sports managers and gamers looking to make informed decisions. This project leverages the power of **data science** and **machine learning** to predict player prices, helping users make better buying and selling decisions. The goal is to:
- Analyze player attributes
- Build a predictive model to estimate the player's price 🎯

## 🛠️ **Technologies and Tools Used**
- **Python** 🐍: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **Scikit-learn**: To implement machine learning models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To document and run the analysis.

## 🧩 **Steps to Solve the Problem**

### 1. 📥 Import Libraries
First, we will import all the necessary libraries for data processing, visualization, and model building:
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn** will be used extensively throughout the project.

### 2. 📊 Load and Explore the Dataset
We will load the FIFA 19 dataset, which contains player statistics and prices:
- **Data Inspection**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and identify important features.
- **Missing Values**: Analyze and handle any missing values in the dataset.

### 3. 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We’ll perform **EDA** to better understand the relationships between player attributes and their prices:
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize key trends and distributions of player statistics and prices.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify the most significant features influencing the price using correlation heatmaps.

### 4. 🔧 Data Preprocessing
We will prepare the dataset for model building by performing necessary preprocessing steps:
- **Handle Missing Data**: Clean missing data by filling in or removing incomplete rows.
- **Feature Encoding**: Convert categorical variables (e.g., player positions) into numerical values using **one-hot encoding** or **label encoding**.
- **Scaling**: Apply **normalization** or **standardization** to scale numerical features, ensuring uniformity for model training.

### 5. 🏗️ Feature Engineering
Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the model's prediction power:
- **Feature Selection**: Identify key player attributes that have a significant impact on price prediction.
- **Feature Creation**: Generate new features if needed to enhance model performance.

### 6. 🤖 Model Building
We will train various machine learning models on the processed dataset:
- **Train/Test Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.
- **Model Selection**: Try out different models, including:
  - **Linear Regression** 📈
  - **Decision Trees** 🌳
  - **Random Forest** 🌲🌲
  - **Gradient Boosting** 🚀
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use **GridSearchCV** to fine-tune the models and optimize their performance.

### 7. 📉 Model Evaluation
We will evaluate the performance of our models using metrics such as:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Quantifies the overall prediction error.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Explains how well the model captures variance in the target price.

### 8. 🔄 Model Comparison and Conclusion
Finally, we will compare the results of different models to determine which one performs best. The project concludes with:
- A summary of key insights gained from the analysis.
- Final recommendations for improving the model's performance. 💡
